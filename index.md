## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2:
This lab was important to me because its was my first time actually trying my hand in coding. Leanring how to use the cin and cout statements would be a skill that i would end up using through out the whole semester! It also opened my eyes to the fun possibilities that coding comes with

Lab 6
I enjoyed Lab 6 as a whole. The reason why I enjoyed lab 6 is because it introduced us to vector which was a much easier way of keeping our code sorted. I also enjoyed the level of customization when coding our sandiwhich. Overall the lab experience was best with my lab partner as well.

Lab 8
I enjoyed this lab because I feel like this lab really made me think. The concept of having a code judge something and drop 2 scores doesn't seem complicated but proved to be when coding. I also enjoyed part 2 as having the compiler print out letters in a patter is reallt neat to me. I enjoy the little typed out pictures seen when texting.
